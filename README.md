# HypernetsTara

This repository contains the code and figures created while interrogating the data output of the 2024 Tara mission from Greece to Monaco.

The primary analyses here are pointed at the matchups between three in situ sensors, and several satellite based products. 

These matchups are performed by a python module called `Hypernets_matchups`, which may become available on GitHub in the future.

The code here then interrogates why many of these matchups are of low quality. Generally this is because of environmental variables interfering with one measurement and not another. 

What we endeavor to achieve with this code is to determine if there are any systemic biases in the matchup data, and if so, what environmental variables are driving these biases.
